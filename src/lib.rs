//! ThreadIsolated is an experimental library for allowing non-`Send`, non-`Sync` types to be
//! shared among multiple threads by requiring that they only be accessed on the thread that
//! created and owns them. Other threads can indirectly access the isolated data by supplying a
//! closure that will be run on the owning thread.
//!
//! The value of ThreadIsolated in a pure Rust application is probably pretty limited (maybe even
//! completely useless). The original motivation for the type is to use Rust on iOS, where it is
//! common to have instances that are only safe to be accessed on the iOS main thread.  Using
//! ThreadIsolated gives Rust a way to have types that are only accessed on the iOS main thread but
//! can still be used (albeit indirectly) from threads created in Rust.
//!
//! In debug builds, `ThreadIsolated` will use thread-local storage and perform runtime checks that
//! all thread access obeys the expected rules. In release builds these checks are not performed.
//!
//! For an example of ThreadIsolated in pure Rust code, see the `test_normal_use` function in the
//! `test` module of `src/lib.rs`.
